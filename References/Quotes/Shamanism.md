## Shamanism Quotes

**T. MCKenna: Food of the Gods (p. 4):**

*"Shamanism is the practice of the Upper Paleolithic tradition of healing, divination and theatrical performance based on natural magic developed ten to fifty thousand years ago."*

*"Mircea Eliad [...] has shown that in all times and places shamanism maintains a surprising internal coherency of practices and belief. Whether the shaman is an Arctic-dwelling Inuit or a Witoto of the Upper Amazon, certain techniques and expectations remain the same."*

**T. MCKenna: Food of the Gods (p. 6)**

*"Shamanism is different. Usually, if drugs are used, the shaman, not the patient, will take the drug. The motivation is also entirely different. The plants used by the shaman are not intended to stimulate the immune system or the body's other natural defences against disease. Rather, the shamanic plants allow the healer to journey into an invisible realm in which the causality of the ordinary world is replaced, with the rationale of natural magic."*

*"In this (natural magic) realm, language, ideas, and meanings have greater power than cause and effect. Sympathies, resonances. intentions, and personal will are linguistically magnified through poetic rhetoric. The imagination is invoked and sometimes its forms are beheld visibly. Within the magical mind-set of the shaman, the ordinary connections of the world and what we call natural laws are deemphasized or ignored."*

**T. MCKenna: Food of the Gods (p. 7)**

*"From the point of view of the psychedelic shaman, the world appears to be more in the nature of an utterance or a tale than in any way related to the leptons and baryons or charge and spin our high priests, the physicists , speak of."*

*"For the Shaman, the cosmos is a tale that becomes true as it is told and as it tells itself. This perspective implies that human imagination can seize the tiller of being in the world. Freedom, personal responsibiltiy, and a humbling awareness of the true size and intelligence of the world combine in this point of view to make it a fitting basis for living an authentic neo-Archaic life."*

*"A reverence for and an immersion in the power of language and communication are the basis of the shamanic path."*

*"This is why the shaman is the remote ancestor of the poet and artist. Our need to feel part of the world seems to demand that we express ourselves through creative activity."*

**T. MCKenna: Food of the Gods (p. 9)**

*"I have shared the group mind that is generated in the vision sessions of the ayahuasqueros. I have seen the magical darts of red light that one shaman can send against another. But more revelatory than paranormal feats of gifted magicians and spiritual healers were the inner riches that I discovered within my own mind at the apex of these experiences. I offer my account as a kind of witness, an Everyman; if these experiences happened to me, then they can be part of the general experience of men and women everywhere."*

*"Thousands of people have, by one means or another, come to the conclusion that psychedelic plants, and the shamanic institutions that their use implies, are profound tools of exploration of the inner depths of the human psyche."*

*"Psychedelic shamans now constitute a worldwide and growing subculture of hyperdimensional explorers, many of whom are scientifically sophisticated."*

*"A Landscape is coming into focus, a region still glimpsed only dimly, but emerging, claiming the attention of rationale discourse--and possibly threatening to cofound it. We may yet remember to behave, how to take our correct place in the connecting pattern, the seamless web of all things."*

*"An understanding of how to achieve this balance (within the web of existence) lingers on in the forgotten and trampled cultures of the rain forests and deserts of the Third World, and in the reserves and reservations into which dominator cultures force their aboriginal people."*

*"The shamanic gnosis is possibly dying; certainly it is changing. Yet the plant hallucinogens that are the source of this, the oldest of human religions, remain a clear running spring, as refreshing as they have always been."*

*"Shamanism is vital and real, because of the individual encounter with the challenge and wonder, the ecstasy and exaltation induced by hallucinogenic plants."*

*"My encounter with shamanism and hallucinogens in the Amazon convinced me of their salvific importance"*

**T. MCKenna: Food of the Gods (p. 11)**

*" At this point the old woman begins to sing. Here is no ordinary song, but an icaro, a magical curing song that in our intoxicated and ecstatic state seems more like a tropical reef fish or animated silk scarf of many colors than a vocal performance. The song is a visible manifestation of power, enfolding us and making us secure"*

**T. MCKenna: Food of the Gods (p. 12)**

*"The writings of Carlos Castaneda and his imitators have resulted in a fad of "shamanic awareness" which, although muddled, has turned the shaman from a peripheral figure in the literature of cultural anthropology into the media role model for full membership in neo-Archaic society."*

*"In spite of the grip that shamanism has on the popular imagination, the paranormal phenomena that it assumes to be actual and true have never been taken seriously by modern science, even if scientists, in a rare case of defence, have called on psychologists and anthropologists to analyze shamanism . This blindness to the paranormal world has created an intellectual blind spot in our normal world view. We are completely unaware of the magical world of the shaman. It is quite simply stranger than we can suppose"*

**T. MCKenna: Food of the Gods (p. 13)**

*"Something profound, unexpected, nearly unimaginable awaits us if we will turn our investigative attention towards the phenomenon of shamanic plant hallucinogens. The people outside of Westen history, those still in the dream time of preliteracy, have kept the flame of a tremendous mystery burning. It will be humbling to admit this and to learn from them, but that too is a part of the Archaic Revival."*
