# “Know Thyself”

The Vedas, Moses, Buddha, Christ, Socrates, Plato, Thomas Hobbes, Benjamin Franklin and even the Wachowski's have addressed the ultimate challenge and most pious project in life: To know thyself.

But what does it mean today and how can we reconnect with a concept that has largely been abandoned in the modern era, yet has the potential to help us understand ourselves beyond our external identities and roles we play in society?

*Once upon a time, in the early 70s when Zen Buddhism was becoming popular in the United States, there was a Zen Buddhist monk who came to this country to try and teach what Zen Buddhism was about. He was interviewed on TV by a famous journalist, let’s call him Dan Smith. Smith said to the Buddhist monk, “So you’ve traveled all around the world teaching Zen Buddhism. What is the most disgusting thing you’ve ever seen?” The Buddhist monk smiled his Zen smile and asked, “Who are you?” Smith, taken aback, replied, “A newspaper reporter… I’m interviewing you?” And the little Buddhist monk smiled and said, “No, no, no, no. Who are you?” At this point, Smith was a little annoyed— he was on national television and was getting fed up. He turned to the Buddhist monk and said, “Look, I’m a father, a husband, a son, I’m a newspaper reporter.” And the Zen little Buddhist monk once again asked, “Who are you?” Dan Smith was completely terrified at this point. He said, “Look, I don’t know, just answer my question.” The Buddhist monk replied, “That is the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen – someone who doesn’t know who he is.”* [from Iconoclasses] (https://iconoclasses.com/2019/09/20/socrates-and-buddha-know-thyself/#:~:text=Once%20upon%20a%20time%2C%20in,let's%20call%20him%20Dan%20Smith). 

## "Origins"
This doctrine of self-knowledge has been a common theme across cultures from the beginning of thought. Jewish, Christian, Vedic, Taoist and Buddhist texts stress the importance of a life with the "aim" of knowing oneself. 

*"Know thyself first; everything follows suit!"* - a [Vedic text reads:] (https://tamilandvedas.com/tag/know-thyself/).
*"Narada asked Sage Sanatkumara to teach him.
Sanatkumara said: ‘Say what you know: I will say what you do not.”
Narada said: *“Lord, I know Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, Atharvana Veda, history and tradition called the fifth Veda, grammer, ritual, mathematics, astrology, mineralogy, logic, economics, physics, meta-physics, zoology, politics, astronomy, fine arts. Lord, yet these things are but elementary knowledge; I do not know the Self. I have heard from masters, that he who knows Self, goes beyond sorrow, I am lost in sorrow. Help me to go beyond.”*

In the Tao Te Ching, [Lao Tzu wrote] (https://www.with.org/tao_te_ching_en.pdf}, *“Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.”*

In Buddhism, to know thyself is one of the [keys to enlightenment] (https://iconoclasses.com/2019/09/20/socrates-and-buddha-know-thyself/):   
*“For the Buddha, ultimate reality is a process of self-realization. Nobody is going to save you. The only person that can liberate you from your own pain and suffering is yourself, and the only person that is going to take the consequences of your own bad acts and misjudgment is also yourself.”*

In monotheistic religions, self-knowledge also played a role in one’s spiritual path. 
Maimonides (or Rambam), one of the old Jewish sages and great commentators on the [Mishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishna) (the first written Torah after centuries of oral tradition), interpreted the first commandment as the law to "Know Yourself."
Translation of [Maimonides on Ignorance of Self:](http://www.mesora.org/KnowThyself.html)
*"[...]And just as the physician, who will heal the bodies, must first know the body that will heal him in general and his parts - what they are, I want to say the human body, and he must know what things will begin and keep them, and what things will heal him and direct them [...]"*
[Maimonides on the first commandment:] (https://torah.org/learning/mlife-ch1law1/)
ואתה יודע, שתיקון המידות הוא ריפוי הנפש וכוחותיה. וכמו שהרופא, אשר ירפא הגופים, צריך שידע תחילה את הגוף אשר ירפאהו בכלל וחלקיו - מה הם, רצוני לומר: גוף האדם, וצריך שידע אילו דברים יחלוהו וישמר מהם, ואילו דברים יבריאוהו ויכוון אליהם, כן רופא הנפש הרוצה לתקן מידות האדם, צריך שידע הנפש בכללה וחלקיה, ומה יחלה אותה ומה יבריאה

Even in [Corinthians 13:5] (https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Corinthians-13-5/), self-knowledge is mentioned as the foundation of faith:
*“Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?”*

Who really first came up with this doctrine is hard to say, as the dating methods of older written texts are not that precise and oral traditions are even more difficult to date, many of the techniques quite oblique. What is apparent however, is that the concept stretches from Asia through the Middle East and Africa over to Europe. It was in Greece where the quest for knowledge of oneself began in the West.

## "From Ancient Greece, across the West"

Greek philosophy laid the basis for Western thought, with the adage “Know Thyself” (γνῶθι σεαυτόν or gnōthi seauton in Greek), influencing thinkers from Thomas Hobbes to Benjamin Franklin. The [saying] (https://arkintime.com/know-thyself/history/) was inscribed at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi (or the Oracle of Delphi) wrote Pausanias, and later adopted by Socrates and Plato. 

Centuries later, in 1651, Thomas Hobbes expanded on “Know Thyself” by introducing the concept of nosce teipsum "Read Thyself" in *[The Leviathan]* (https://web.archive.org/web/20101127130924/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-contents.html). He argued that we can learn more by studying ourselves – our feelings, thoughts, motives, etc. - than looking to others.  

*"But to teach us that for the similitude of the thoughts and passions of one man, to the thoughts and passions of another, whosoever looketh into himself and considereth what he doth when he does think, opine, reason, hope, fear, etc., and upon what grounds; he shall thereby read and know what are the thoughts and passions of all other men upon the like occasions."*

Benjamin Franklin elucidated the [complexity of knowing oneself] (https://books.google.de/books?id=MYkTAQAAMAAJ&dq=Autobiography,+Sayings+of+Poor+Richard,+Letters&pg=PA195&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false), comparing it to the impenetrability of steel and diamonds: *"There are three Things extremely hard, Steel, a Diamond, and to know one's self."*

While the importance of self-inquiry has waned in recent years, we can see a [few references] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl0rqoRbzzU) to the age-old quest to “Know Thyself” in popular culture. In the *Matrix* and *Matrix Revolutions*, the Wachowskis included temet nosce above the Oracle’s door, giving a nod to the Ancient Greeks. 

## “A spiritual & philosophical drought”

We can see that throughout both Western and Eastern traditions – from the Vedas to Judeo-Christian teachings, to Western philosophy – knowing thyself has been emphasized as a way to enrich our lives and find purpose.

In general though, we have abandoned the quest to turn inward and examine who we really are, instead distracting ourselves in nearly any way possible. Why have we stopped listening to the wisdom imparted to us by a rich heritage of thought that spans cultures and traditions, and started looking for answers outside of ourselves? Is it due to our hardened dualistic thinking patterns, separating mind from matter, ourselves from the other? Would it help to break up these patterns from time to time and acquire a more holistic view or experience? 

We are left with the question of where to go from here, and how we can incorporate this approach into our lives today.

## "Practical application"

There are more general [methods of getting to know ourselves] (https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/changepower/201603/know-yourself-6-specific-ways-know-who-you-are), such as identifying and examining our values, interests, temperament, strengths, goals, etc. We can also turn to time-tested spiritual and even esoteric approaches for a deeper understanding of the self, [carrying such traditions into the present day] (https://yogashanti.com/focus/sept-12-knowing-yourself-tracey-toomey-mcquade-joyce-englander/#.YJqEXLUzY2w).

The practice of Svādhyāya (knowing oneself) is foundational in yogic traditions. Through meditation and asanas, one examines the mental, spiritual and physical self together as one.

Hindu sage [Ramana Maharshi] (https://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/teachings/instructions/) focused much of his work on Vichara, "Self-enquiry", the constant attention to the inner awareness of "I" or "I am."

In his 1980 book, [Man Know Thyself], (https://www.lightparty.com/Spirituality/ManKnowThyself/ManKnowThyself.html) Raphael Ornstein M.D. gives insight into a practical path to self-knowledge that is very accessible to the analytical Western mind, involving Qabbalah and also the Tarot. The tarot cards are often seen as a mirror of what you are experiencing in your life, encouraging self-reflection and contemplation. They can be a powerful tool our modern-day quest to “Know Thyself.”

## "Ending"

Since the beginning of thought we have had the urge to "Know Thyself.” But why?  Might it be that within us lies an answer so powerful and life-changing, that it's difficult to imagine, let alone attempt to realize? Let us try together, while creating something meaningful along the way.
