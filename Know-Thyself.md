# “Know thy self”

What do ancient scrolls, sacred and sacral texts, scholars, thinkers and philosophers all have in common? They agree that to "know thy self" is the ultimate challenge and most pious project in life.

But what does it mean today and how can we reconnect with a concept that has largely been abandoned in the modern era, yet has the potential to help us understand ourselves beyond our external identities and roles we play in society?

*Once upon a time, in the early 70s when Zen Buddhism was becoming popular in the United States, there was a Zen Buddhist monk who came to this country to try and teach what Zen Buddhism was about. He was interviewed on TV by a famous journalist, let’s call him Dan Smith. Smith said to the Buddhist monk, “So you’ve traveled all around the world teaching Zen Buddhism. What is the most disgusting thing you’ve ever seen?” The Buddhist monk smiled his Zen smile and asked, “Who are you?” Smith, taken aback, replied, “A newspaper reporter… I’m interviewing you?” And the little Buddhist monk smiled and said, “No, no, no, no. Who are you?” At this point, Smith was a little annoyed— he was on national television and was getting fed up. He turned to the Buddhist monk and said, “Look, I’m a father, a husband, a son, I’m a newspaper reporter.” And the Zen little Buddhist monk once again asked, “Who are you?” Dan Smith was completely terrified at this point. He said, “Look, I don’t know, just answer my question.” The Buddhist monk replied, “That is the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen - someone who doesn’t know who he is.”* [from Iconoclasses](https://iconoclasses.com/2019/09/20/socrates-and-buddha-know-thyself/#:~:text=Once%20upon%20a%20time%2C%20in,let's%20call%20him%20Dan%20Smith). 

# PART I

## "Origins"

This doctrine of self-knowledge has been a common theme across cultures from the beginning of thought. Archaic religious texts and tribal and oral traditions stress the importance of a life with the "aim" of knowing oneself. 

*"Know thyself first; everything follows suit!"* - a [Vedic text reads.](https://tamilandvedas.com/tag/know-thyself)
*"Narada asked Sage Sanatkumara to teach him.
Sanatkumara said: ‘Say what you know: I will say what you do not.'
Narada said: *'Lord, I know Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, Atharvana Veda, history and tradition called the fifth Veda, grammer, ritual, mathematics, astrology, mineralogy, logic, economics, physics, meta-physics, zoology, politics, astronomy, fine arts. Lord, yet these things are but elementary knowledge; I do not know the Self. I have heard from masters, that he who knows Self, goes beyond sorrow, I am lost in sorrow. Help me to go beyond.'"*

In the Tao Te Ching, [Lao Tzu wrote](https://www.with.org/tao_te_ching_en.pdf), *“Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.”*

In Buddhism, to know thy self is one of the [keys to enlightenment](https://iconoclasses.com/2019/09/20/socrates-and-buddha-know-thyself/): *“For the Buddha, ultimate reality is a process of self-realisation. Nobody is going to save you. The only person that can liberate you from your own pain and suffering is yourself, and the only person that is going to take the consequences of your own bad acts and misjudgment is also yourself.”*

In monotheistic religions, self-knowledge has also played a role in one’s spiritual path. 
Maimonides (or Rambam), one of the old Jewish sages and great commentators on the [Mishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishna) (the first written Torah after centuries of oral tradition), interpreted the first commandment as the law to "Know Yourself." [Maimonides on Ignorance of Self.](http://www.mesora.org/KnowThyself.html)

The concept extends to Islamic scripture in the quest to comprehend human emotion and become closer to Allah. In the [Hadith of the Prophet Muhammed](https://www.hubeali.com/online-books/online-english-books/bihar-al-anwaar/), it is written: *“Whosoever knows himself knows his Lord.”* 

Even in [Corinthians 13:5](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Corinthians-13-5/), self-knowledge is mentioned as the foundation of faith: *“Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?”*

Who really first came up with this doctrine is hard to say, as the dating methods of older written texts are not that precise and oral traditions are even more difficult to date, many of the techniques quite oblique. However who or where the inquiry came from "first" is of no relevance at all. What is important is that the concept stretches from East to West and North to South. 

## "From Ancient Greece, across the West"

Greek philosophy laid the basis for Western thought, including the introduction of [*gnōthi seauton* (know thy self)](https://arkintime.com/know-thyself/history/), which was inscribed at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi (or the Oracle of Delphi). The adage was later adopted by Socrates and Plato. 

In 1651, Thomas Hobbes expanded on the concept with the Latin phrase *nosce teipsum* (read thy self) in *[The Leviathan](https://web.archive.org/web/20101127130924/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-contents.html).* He argued that we can learn more by studying ourselves - our feelings, thoughts, motives, etc. - than looking to others.  

*"But to teach us that for the similitude of the thoughts and passions of one man, to the thoughts and passions of another, whosoever looketh into himself and considereth what he doth when he does think, opine, reason, hope, fear, etc., and upon what grounds; he shall thereby read and know what are the thoughts and passions of all other men upon the like occasions."*

Benjamin Franklin elucidated the [complexity of knowing oneself](https://books.google.de/books?id=MYkTAQAAMAAJ&dq=Autobiography,+Sayings+of+Poor+Richard,+Letters&pg=PA195&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false), comparing it to the impenetrability of steel and diamonds: *"There are three Things extremely hard, Steel, a Diamond, and to know one's self."*

While the importance of self-inquiry has waned in recent years, we can see a [few references](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl0rqoRbzzU) to the age-old quest in popular culture. In the *Matrix* and *Matrix Revolutions*, the Wachowskis included *temet nosce* (know thy self) above the Oracle’s door, giving a nod to the Ancient Greeks and subsequent philosophers. 

## “A spiritual & philosophical drought”

We can see that throughout both Western and Eastern traditions - from the Vedas to monotheistic teachings, to Western philosophy - to know thy self has been emphasised as a way to enrich our lives and find purpose.

In general though, we have abandoned the quest to turn inward and examine who we really are, instead distracting ourselves in nearly any way possible. Why have we stopped listening to the wisdom imparted to us by a rich heritage of thought that spans cultures and traditions, and started looking for answers outside of ourselves? Is it due to our hardened dualistic thinking patterns, separating mind from matter, ourselves from the other? Would it help to break up these patterns from time to time and acquire a more holistic view or experience? 

We are left with the question of where to go from here, and how we can incorporate this approach into our lives today.

*"We may yet remember to behave, how to take our correct place in the connecting pattern, the seamless web of all things."* - T. McKenna in [*Food of the Gods (p.9)*](http://sociology.morrisville.edu/readings/SOCI270/FoodOfTheGods-McKenna-p8-14.pdf)


# PART II

## "Practical application"

There are more general [methods of getting to know ourselves](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/changepower/201603/know-yourself-6-specific-ways-know-who-you-are), such as identifying and examining our values, interests, temperament, strengths, goals, etc. - attributes that make up some parts of the "Self". 

What about questions of a different quality altogether? Like how is the Self related to others? Is there a Self without others? Or where and how does the Self fit into the cosmic (universal?) web? Sometimes it makes sense to turn to time-tested tribal, spiritual or esoteric approaches for a deeper understanding of oneself. 

*"An understanding of how to achieve this balance (within the web of existence) lingers on in the forgotten and trampled cultures of the rain forests and deserts of the Third World, and in the reserves and reservations into which dominator cultures force their aboriginal people."* - T. McKenna [*Food of the Gods (p.9)*](http://sociology.morrisville.edu/readings/SOCI270/FoodOfTheGods-McKenna-p8-14.pdf)

The practice of *Svādhyāya* (knowing oneself) is foundational in yogic traditions. Through meditation and asanas, one examines the mental, spiritual and physical self together as one.

Hindu sage [Ramana Maharshi](https://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/teachings/instructions/) focused much of his work on *Vichara* (self-enquiry), the constant attention to the inner awareness of "I" or "I am."

Not only Yogis are [carrying such traditions into the present day](https://yogashanti.com/focus/sept-12-knowing-yourself-tracey-toomey-mcquade-joyce-englander/#.YJqEXLUzY2w), also Shamans from the Amazonas and other tribal cultures with a rich plant medicine heritage are nowadays being introduced to the "Western" world. 

## Shamanism

*"Shamanism is the practice of the Upper Paleolithic tradition of healing, divination and theatrical performance based on natural magic developed ten to fifty thousand years ago."* - T. McKenna in [*Food of the Gods (p.4)*](http://sociology.morrisville.edu/readings/SOCI270/FoodOfTheGods-McKenna-p8-14.pdf)

In some Shamanic cultures a coming of age ritual often involves the ingestion of local plant hallucinogens in order for the individual to find their place within the cosmic order. Shamans can be found in almost all tribal cultures. Sadly, there are not that many living tribes left willing or able to communicate with the outside world. In particular, little is known about the aboriginal tribes in Australia, whereas the Ahuyasca culture from the Amazon is becoming extremely popular. Searching for answers or to heal psychological traumas, many individuals seek out Shamans for help. 

*For the Shaman, the cosmos is a tale that becomes true as it is told and as it tells itself. This perspective implies that human imagination can seize the tiller of being in the world."*  - T. McKenna in [*Food of the Gods (p.7)*](http://sociology.morrisville.edu/readings/SOCI270/FoodOfTheGods-McKenna-p8-14.pdf)

They are known to be in contact with the spirit world, some can channel life energy through songs to heal psychological and psychosomatic wounds, as Terence McKenna wrote, *"Here is no ordinary song, but an icaro, a magical curing song that in our intoxicated and ecstatic state seems more like a tropical reef fish or animated silk scarf of many colors than a vocal performance The song is a visible manifestation of power, enfolding us and making us secure"*

However, finding an authentic and practicing Shaman is not easily done, for - as sad as it is - copycats and charlatans offering silver bullet solutions for all problems are reportedly tainting the heritage.

*"The writings of Carlos Castaneda and his imitators have resulted in a fad of 'shamanic awareness' which, although muddled, has turned the shaman from a peripheral figure [...] into the media role model for full membership in neo-Archaic society."* - T. McKenna [*Food of the Gods (p.12)*](http://sociology.morrisville.edu/readings/SOCI270/FoodOfTheGods-McKenna-p8-14.pdf)

Nonetheless, the shaman community is growing and more able minnds are joining the cause. 

*"Psychedelic shamans now constitute a worldwide and growing subculture of hyperdimensional explorers, many of whom are scientifically sophisticated."* - T. McKenna [*Food of the Gods (p.9)*](http://sociology.morrisville.edu/readings/SOCI270/FoodOfTheGods-McKenna-p8-14.pdf)


## Pracitcal Magic 

In his 1980 book, [*Man Know Thyself*](https://www.lightparty.com/Spirituality/ManKnowThyself/ManKnowThyself.html), Raphael Ornstein M.D. gives insight into a practical path to self-knowledge that is very accessible to the analytical Western mind, involving Qabbalah, practical magic and also the Tarot. The Tarot cards are often seen as a mirror of what you are experiencing in your life, encouraging self-reflection and contemplation. They can be a powerful tool to our modern-day quest to know or read thy self.

## "Ending"

But why since the beginning of thought have we had the urge to know thy self?  Might it be that within us lies an answer so powerful and life-changing, that it's difficult to imagine, let alone attempt to realise? As Terence McKenna put it graciously in his book *Food of the Gods*: *"We are completely unaware of the magical world of the shaman. It is quite simply stranger than we can suppose."*

Let us try together to enter this magical world, while creating something meaningful in the bodily realm along the way. 
What that might be? Think of an autonomous organisation for creators that is self sustaining/growing and managed without hierarchy by all its participants. How does this tie into self-knowledge or something like the Tarot?

The answers can soon be found here. Meanwhile it's recommended to **read thy self**.
