# Know Thyself
The Veda, Moses, Buddha, Christ, Plato, Benjamin Franklin and even the Wachowski's knew of and spoke about the ultimate challenge and most pious project in life: To know thyself.
What does it mean today?

*Once upon a time, in the early 70s when Zen Buddhism was becoming popular in the United States, there was a Zen Buddhist monk who came to this country to try and teach what Zen Buddhism was about. He was interviewed on TV by a famous journalist, let’s call him Dan Smith. Smith said to the Buddhist monk, “So you’ve traveled all around the world teaching Zen Buddhism. What is the most disgusting thing you’ve ever seen?” The Buddhist monk smiled his Zen smile and asked, “Who are you?” Smith, taken aback, replied, “A newspaper reporter… I’m interviewing you?” And the little Buddhist monk smiled and said, “No, no, no, no. Who are you?” At this point, Smith was a little annoyed— he was on national television and was getting fed up. He turned to the Buddhist monk and said, “Look, I’m a father, a husband, a son, I’m a newspaper reporter.” And the Zen little Buddhist monk once again asked, “Who are you?” Dan Smith was completely terrified at this point. He said, “Look, I don’t know, just answer my question.” The Buddhist monk replied, “That is the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen – someone who doesn’t know who he is.”*

## "Origins"
This doctrine of self knowledge has been a common theme across cultures from the beginning of thought. Jewish, Christian, Vedic and Buddhist texts stress the importance of a life with the "aim" of self knowledge.
"Know thyself first; everything follows suit!" - a Vedic text reads:
*"Narada asked Sage Sanatkumara to teach him.
Sanatkumara said: ‘Say what you know: I will say what you do not.’
Narada said:* ‘Lord, I know Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, Atharvana Veda, history and tradition called the fifth Veda, grammer, ritual, mathematics, astrology, mineralogy, logic, economics, physics, meta-physics, zoology, politics, astronomy, fine arts. ‘Lord, yet these things are but elementary knowledge; I do not know the Self. I have heard from masters, that he who knows Self, goes beyond sorrow, I am lost in sorrow. Help me to go beyond’.*
Who really first came across this doctrine is hard to say as the dating methods of written texts are not that precise and oral tradition dating techniques are much more oblique.
What is apparent however is that it stretches from Asia through the middle east and Africa over to Europe. Where it was picked up in Greece and spawned the quest for knowledge of self in the West.

## "The Greeks & the West"
- gnōthi seauton ( γνῶθι σεαυτόν ), prominent usage in west in Greece
- inscirbed as first maxime (of 3) in temple of Apollo in Delphi
- Western lineage: Sokrates -> Plato -> ... -> Thomas Hobbes "The Leviathan": Read Thyself, signaling that reading one self one can acquire higher and more profound wisdom than when reading books ->
... -> Benjamin Franklin "There are three Things extremely hard, Steel, a Diamond, and to know one's self."[29] -> The Matrix (over Oracle door)
  - also in The Art of War, the maxim 知彼知己，百战不殆 means "know others and know thyself, and you will not be endangered by innumerable battles". In this saying by Sun Zi (孙子, Sun Tze), the idea of knowing oneself is paramount.

## A spiritual drought

When did we stop listening to the great minds and start looking for answers outside of ourselves? Is it due to our hardened dualistic thinking patterns, separating mind from matter? Would it help to break up these patterns from time to time and acquire a more holistic view or experience?

Maimonides (or Rambam), one of the old Jewish sages and great commentators on the [Mishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishna) (the first written Torah after centuries of oral tradition), interpreted the first commandment as the law to "Know Yourself."

Google translation of [Rambam on Ignorance of Self:](http://www.mesora.org/KnowThyself.html)
*"[...]And just as the physician, who will heal the bodies, must first know the body that will heal him in general and his parts - what they are, I want to say the human body, and he must know what things will begin and keep them, and what things will heal him and direct them [...]"*
[Maimonides on the first commandment:](https://torah.org/learning/mlife-ch1law1/)
ואתה יודע, שתיקון המידות הוא ריפוי הנפש וכוחותיה. וכמו שהרופא, אשר ירפא הגופים, צריך שידע תחילה את הגוף אשר ירפאהו בכלל וחלקיו - מה הם, רצוני לומר: גוף האדם, וצריך שידע אילו דברים יחלוהו וישמר מהם, ואילו דברים יבריאוהו ויכוון אליהם, כן רופא הנפש הרוצה לתקן מידות האדם, צריך שידע הנפש בכללה וחלקיה, ומה יחלה אותה ומה יבריאה

Even in Corinthians 13:5, self knowledge is mentioned as the foundation of faith:
*“Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?”*
from [King James Bible](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Corinthians-13-5/)

In contrast, Eastern traditions gave a non-dualistic interpretation:

*“The Buddha said that when we do something, we must do it with our full presence, our full mindfulness. We’re so distracted multitasking that we lose sight of our single purpose.”*

from [Iconcalss](https://iconoclasses.com/2019/09/20/socrates-and-buddha-know-thyself/)

## "Practical application"

In his 1980 book, [Man Know Thyself], Raphael Ornstein M.D.(https://www.lightparty.com/Spirituality/ManKnowThyself/ManKnowThyself.html)
gives insight into a practical path to self knowledge that is very accessible to the analytical Western mind. Involving Qabbalah and also the Tarot.

[Dyhana /Yoga / Meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhy%C4%81na_in_Hinduism)
- Physical practices toward self knowledge
- Self-directed awareness for self realization

## "Ending"
So why then, since the beginning of thought, have we had the urge to "Know Thysef"? Might it be that within us lies an answer so powerful and life-changing, that it's difficult to imagine, let alone attempt to realize? Let us try together, while creating something meaningful along the way.
