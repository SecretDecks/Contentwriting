## What is SecretDecks¬Æ?
SecretDecks is the soul of the autonomous creator organisation we're currently creating. Like a brand to a company, it generates value external to the inherent value of the organisation and can thus help to sustain and nourish it in a transcendental way.

## Why is SecretDecks¬Æ?
SecretDecks¬Æ is acting as the seed catalysing a new kind of endeavour, called a Autonomus Creator Organization - ACO for short.
