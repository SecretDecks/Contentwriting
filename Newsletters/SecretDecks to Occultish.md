## Intro
Calling all creators! SecretDecks® looks to you if you’ve ever reinterpreted the Tarot and made your own deck... or perhaps you feel inspired to do so? 
Are you an artist? Build a new global fanbase, make a living off your digital art without any middlemen, as well as own & manage your copyrights!
What if you're not an aritst? Join us anyway and find out how you can help us to help each other and what you can get in return! 
There's enough to do for everyone, as we're building the future of decentralised collaboration and autonomus organisation. 

We want to give you the chance to showcase your recreation and enable you to sell your Tarot art as digital collectibles in a new, innovative way. It’s a way we believe not only has huge momentum now - it also builds on a technology that is rocketing into the future while allowing art and its creators more autonomy. 

SecretDecks® builds on blockchain technology with an autonomous organisation. Your art would be turned into a cryptographically-secure token called an NFT. The copyright will always remain with you, the creator(s). 

## What is a digital collectable/NFT ?
Each NFT contains unique information (metadata), like the creator's digital fingerprint and a certificate of authenticity. That makes it both distinct from any other NFT and easily verifiable. And it means that the creation and circulation of fake collectibles is distinctively more difficult, as all interaction on a blockchain can be verified and traced back to the original creator. Similar to selling a painting outside a gallery, it will be a personal exchange between buyer and artist. 

How does an NFT built on the blockchain differ from simply selling it from a website on the internet? There is no website where you can sell unique digital art pieces without the need to set up a payment gateway. Additionally, selling art as an NFT enables lifelong royalties. Each time a digital artwork is resold, the artist receives a royalty. 

## Not a digital artist? 
No worries, we will connect you with creative minds who are technically well-versed, in a remote incubator program! You can find collaborators to create new decks or digitise existing ones that you’ve already created. We’re here to help make this process as smooth as possible and here to answer any questions that may come up, now or in the future.

## What and Who is SecretDecks®?
We’re a group of creators who seek to introduce the Tarot, through divination and communication with the subconscious, to a new realm of self-sovereignty. SecretDecks® will function as a soul-like catalyst for an Autonomous Creator Organisation (ACO). More in the next section about what exactly an ACO is. 

We’re well-experienced with the technical innovations of NFTs and Crypto in general. This is exactly why we look to you and your expertise to help us join together the two different realities of Crypto and Tarot. In combining these two fields, we essentially only want to make the process of creation, curation, distribution and sales, etc. more self-organised, secure and private for creators, collectors, buyers, as well as patrons. 
 
While the Tarot is typically experienced in-person, this new platform won’t take the magic away - Tarot relates to and helps us understand the Self, which transcends time and space. In fact, this platform will offer more people the chance to walk the path of self-knowledge and gain insight into their subconscious and life in general. The internet has already broken the boundaries of moving many aspects of our lives to the virtual world, but with risks involved. SecretDecks® will enable privacy and autonomy, while maintaining the magic of the very powerful tool that is Tarot.

## What is an Autonomous Creator Organisation (ACO)?
An organisational layer (network) of groups of creators clustered around an idea. Within this network they can autonomously coordinate curation, voting (consensus-building), funding, creation, as well as distribution and sales of digital assets. All supported by a token (that grows in value over time, as the network grows and tokens are bought and burned).

## How do they come together?
Think digital collectibles in the form of Tarot cards, conjured up by creators across the globe and distributed and utlised within an ecosystem of SecretDecks® apps that work together to fuel demand for the collectible cards and the experiences they entail.

In order to generate interest and value, as well as motivate participants and test the ACO concept in a real world environment, it is required to have some value-added mechanism. Thus a small percentage (appr. 0.5%-1%) of the collectible sales will flow into the ACO network. 

### Is there a goal?
The concept works if at least 85% of sales revenue is received by the creator(s) directly and more than 12 drops of decks have been successfully facilitated.

## Thank you for taking the time to read this! 
It’s a lot of information, but we seek to create an autonomous organisation by creators, for creators. Thus, transparency and the sharing of information are key. Your input also plays a critical role in laying the groundwork to build such an organisation, so we welcome any and all questions you may have.
