# Who are we
- Short (100 words) intro about each core founding member
- Uniting crypto & tarot (<abstract from occultish newsletter>)

# What are we now
- a collection of creative minds from around the world orbiting around a common goal
- building consensus over initial consensus building mechanisms 
- reaching out to other like minded teams and projects ("finding the others"
- setting up decentralised workflows, that are easy to track in order to attribute contribution
- building an onboarding process for 20+ & 100+ community members

# Where we want to go
- the goal is to create a holistic being comprised of 
	- an active community (catalysing) [external membrane connected to nervous system tendrils]
	- and (self organising/non-hierachical/ teams (building) [Nervous System (Heart/Brain)]
	- an autonomous organisation structure (framing) [DNA] 
	- a "Product" (enrichting) [Soul] 
- That being  can evolve by adapting the nervous system to different environmental parameters
- Additionally it can self replicate and thus allowing a new soul to enter
